> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Google Cloud Prerequisites**
> Before using this extension, ensure your GCP project is properly configured:
> 1. **Enable APIs**: Enable the **Vertex AI API** (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`) in the Google Cloud Console ([Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment)).
> 2. **IAM Roles**: Your authenticated user/service account requires the **Vertex AI User** (`roles/aiplatform.user`) role ([Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control)).
> 3. **Model Access**: To use Anthropic Claude models, you must manually find them in the **Vertex AI Model Garden** and click **Enable** to accept the terms of service ([Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude)).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install**: Find **Vertex AI Models Chat Provider** in the VS Code Marketplace and click Install.
2. **Authenticate**: Ensure you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed and run:

    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

3. **Configure**: Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`) and set your **GCP Project ID** in `vertexAiChat.projectId`.
4. **Chat**: Open the Chat panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) and select a **Vertex** model from the picker.

## 🌟 Why Project-Based Authentication?

This extension uses your **GCP Project ID** and **Application Default Credentials (ADC)** instead of traditional API keys. This approach offers several professional advantages:

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Credentials stay in your system's secure store via `gcloud`. There are no sensitive API keys to paste, store in plain text, or rotate manually.
- **🏢 Automatic Billing Switching**: By setting the Project ID in your workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`, billing for LLM usage automatically switches as you move between different client or internal projects.
- **📈 Centralized Governance**: Organization admins can manage model access and quotas centrally through the Google Cloud Console, which automatically applies to all developers using that Project ID.
- **⚡ Consistent Performance**: Leveraging your own GCP project quotas ensures you aren't sharing rate limits with other users on a global API key.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Advanced Gemini Support**: Full support for **Gemini 3 Flash & Pro**, including "High Thinking" modes with thought block rendering and signature preservation.
- **⚡ Anthropic Performance**: Native support for **Claude Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku**, featuring automated **Prompt Caching (Ephemeral)** to reduce latency and costs for long conversations.
- **🔑 Actionable Auth**: Improved detection of expired credentials with a one-click "Login with gcloud" fix directly from VS Code.
- **🪄 AI Commit Messages**: Generate professional, conventional commit messages from staged Git changes with one click from the Source Control view.
- **📊 Local Usage Dashboard and Real Time Costs Estimation**: An interactive, ECharts-powered dashboard to track your individual costs, token consumption, and payload metrics—all stored locally and updated in real time.

- **🔍 Smart Discovery**: Automatically probes regional endpoints (`global`, `us-east5`, `europe-west1`, `asia-southeast1`) to find and register only the models available in your specific GCP project.
- **👁️ Multimodal Vision**: Paste images directly into chat for analysis by vision-capable models like Claude 4.6 and Gemini 3.
- **🛠️ Tool Calling**: Support for streaming parallel tool execution, enabling models to interact with VS Code agents and external tools.
