## Core Concepts

### Commit Message Generation
The extension provides an AI-powered commit message generator that integrates directly with the VS Code Source Control Management (SCM) view. It analyzes staged `git diff` outputs and produces professional messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. 

Key aspects of the generation logic include:
- **Git Integration**: Uses the `vscode.git` extension to identify staged changes and retrieve diff data using `diffIndexWithHEAD`.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Sends the diff to the `gemini-3-flash-preview` model, emphasizing the "why" and "what" of the changes rather than just listing line modifications.
- **Strict Formatting**: The system prompt enforces specific constraints: imperative present tense, no trailing periods, and a 72-character limit for subject lines.
- **Streaming UI**: The generated message is streamed directly into the SCM input box, providing immediate feedback to the developer.
- **Token Efficiency**: Aggregates all staged diffs into a single request to minimize model overhead and provides detailed logging of processed file paths.

## API Reference

### generateCommitMessage
[source](../src/CommitMessage.ts)
This function acts as the command handler for `vertexAiChat.generateCommitMessage`. It facilitates the end-to-end workflow of converting staged code changes into a structured commit message.

**Workflow:**
1. **Repository Resolution**: Detects the relevant Git repository based on the provided `resourceUri` or active workspace.
2. **Diff Extraction**: Collects and joins all non-empty staged diffs, logging relative file paths to the **Vertex AI Models: Commit Message** output channel.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Wraps the diff in a system prompt that enforces strict rules: imperative present tense, 72-character limits for subjects, and specific commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`).
4. **LLM Invocation**: Calls the `VertexGoogleProvider` using a `gemini-3-flash-preview` model. It utilizes a custom system message role (role 0) to pass instructions to the provider.
5. **SCM Update**: Initially sets the Git input box to "⏳ Generating commit message…" and then populates it with the streamed result, trimmed of whitespace.
6. **Usage Recording**: Tracks token usage (input, output, cache_read, cache_create) and character counts for the local usage dashboard via the `UsageTrackerService`.

**Parameters:**
- `provider`: `VertexGoogleProvider` — The provider instance used to communicate with Vertex AI.
- `usageTracker`: `UsageTrackerService` — Service used to record consumption metrics for the cost dashboard.
- `resourceUri`: `vscode.Uri` (optional) — An optional URI identifying the repository context.

## Examples

### Conventional Commit Output
The generator produces raw text designed to be used immediately in a Git commit, following strict output constraints (no markdown blocks, no conversational filler):

```text
feat(auth): add JWT validation to middleware

The previous implementation relied on session cookies. This introduces 
stateless JWT verification to support horizontal scaling.
```

### Git SCM Integration
The function is typically triggered via the magic wand icon in the SCM view title bar or via the Command Palette. It automatically handles the "⏳ Generating..." state within the input box until the stream is complete and logs the final generated message to the internal diagnostics channel.
